        <p>
          In recent years there has been a rapid expansion of Javascript’s ecosystem. To this
          fact has contributed both the establishment of the internet as a development platform
          for web applications as well as the Node.js platform, which offered the opportunity to
          use the language outside the browser, for the development of any kind of application.
          Node’s success lead to the creation of the first package manager for JavaScript, which
          now hosts tens of thousands of JavaScript packages. The accumulation of a large number
          of software packages in a relatively short time has made the selection and detection of
          valuable packages difficult. The large volume of information and data available both in
          repositories and source code could be utilized for the improvement and evaluation of the
          available software. The application aims to enhance the software package selection process
          through the use of quality metrics for their assessment. Although we currently only use
          static analysis metrics we want to expand the information associated with each package
          using data from their repositories and issue trackers or a combination of them.

          The application is divided into the following sections:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Analytics</b>. You can search for npm packages and see their profiles filled with software
            quality metrics extracted by our analyzers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Comparison</b>. You can compare two packages side by side based on some major metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Visualization</b>. You can visualize and interact with the dependency graphs.
          </li>
        </ul>

          The four major components are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b> Web Server</b>. A Node.js (hapi) server with an Angular frontend.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Static analysis services:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint" target="_blank"> eslint </a> </li>
              <li> <a href="https://github.com/escomplex/escomplex" target="_blank"> escomplex </a> </li>
              <li> <a href="https://github.com/danielstjules/jsinspect" target="_blank"> jsinspect </a> </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Graph database</b>. It is used to better examine the dependency graph, leveraging the
                                     <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Tinkerpop</a> stack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> NoSQL database</b>. A couchDB instance that holds a copy of the npm registry and the
                                     results of the static analyzers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every change on the official npm registry is propagated into our system so it remains up-to-date.
          The whole system is hosted in VMs provided by <a href="https://okeanos.grnet.gr" target="_blank">~okeanos</a>.
